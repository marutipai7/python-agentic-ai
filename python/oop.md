ðŸ§  PART 1: Python OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
ðŸ§¾ What is OOP?
OOP is a way to organize code by grouping related data and functions into "objects". Think of it like describing a "Car" â€” with properties (color, speed) and actions (drive, brake).

ðŸ”‘ Four Main Concepts of OOP
| Concept       | Simple Meaning                      | Example                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class         | A blueprint                         | "Car" is a class                                          |
| Object        | A real version of the class         | `my_car = Car()`                                          |
| Inheritance   | Child class using parentâ€™s features | `ElectricCar(Car)`                                        |
| Encapsulation | Hide internal details               | Use `get_name()` instead of directly accessing a variable |
| Polymorphism  | Same method works differently       | `speak()` in Dog vs Cat                                   |



ðŸ”¹ What is OOP?
OOP means writing code by grouping data (attributes) and actions (methods) into objects.

Think of it like building with LEGO blocks â€” each object has a specific purpose.

ðŸ”¸ Key Concepts:

| Concept    | Meaning                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `class`    | Blueprint or design                              |
| `object`   | Real-world version of the class                  |
| `__init__` | Constructor method (runs when object is created) |
| `self`     | Refers to the current object                     |
| `method`   | Function inside a class                          |
